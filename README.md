This repository contains end-to-end code for a data-driven decision-making process utilizing gigabytes of data from the MicroBooNE detector. The project spans from data ideation to production, ensuring robust and efficient data handling and analysis.
Process Description
1. Data Decoding and Reorganization:
 Converts binary data from 1.6 ms chunks to 2.3 ms chunks, aligning with detector requirements for full ionization collection.
2. Pattern Recognition and Filtering:
 Implements traditional algorithms to identify specific topologies and patterns within the data.
3. Filters out data once the specified patterns are detected, optimizing for targeted analysis.

Key Features
Efficient Data Handling: Processes large datasets to meet specific detector time window requirements.
Robust Pattern Recognition: Utilizes proven algorithms for accurate data filtering.
End-to-End Workflow: Covers the complete lifecycle from data decoding to pattern identification and filtering.
